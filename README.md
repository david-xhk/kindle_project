## Getting started

Here's what you need to do to get all the servers started.

1. Edit `defaults` and `credentials` with your preferred configurations.

2. Run `./setup.sh`. You can check `logs/` for the setup progress.

3. Once `./setup.sh` finishes running, you may start the analytics by running `./run_analytics`.
